This post is part of a multi-part series on my indoor growing. If you want, you can start from [Part 1](http://blog.shh.sh/2018/02/11/indoor-growing-project-part-1/).

I have decided that I need more science in this project, so it's off to SparkFun and Adafruit for some sensors. They've just been ordered, so updates to come as I put things together and hook them up. Here's a sneak preview of what's to come.

[SparkFun Environmental Combo Breakout - CCS811/BME280](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14348):

[Chirp! The Plant Watering Alarm](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1965)Â (I am not going to have it chirp at all):

[SI1145 Digital UV Index / IR / Visible Light Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1777):

I have bought more than one of some of these, and will be hooking them all up over I2C to log to a spare Raspberry Pi 3 I have lying around. For now I have to wait until the order arrives.

As tempting as it is to buy a [$80 weather kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8942), I have no means to set that up for now and so it is out of scope for this (admittedly restricted to indoors) project.
