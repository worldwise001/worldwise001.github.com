If you want the parts list, scroll to the very bottom of the post.

### The Problem

So the other day (by which I mean several months ago) I bought this beautiful [absolute unit](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/kallax-shelf-unit-white-70301537/) to serve as my backdrop (but also to hold stuff). If you are unfamiliar with what this looks like, it looks like this:

As a backdrop, I wanted to fill it with fun displays or knickknacks, but part of that plan required understanding how i wanted to place the different displays. So I decided to measure the dimensions, finding that it was around 13" x 13" x 15" (H x W x D):

About simultaneously, I happened to be writing [this post](https://www.shh.sh/2020/09/06/full-body-tracking.html) on full body tracking and was starting to see the effects of my old build from around 2016 starting to show its age, as the multiple viewpoints/cameras for VR + stream encoding + almost-4k-monitor did make the framerate start to stutter:

- i5-4440 3.3GHz
- 16GB RAM
- nVidia 1080 GTX

So ok, probably time to build a new computer, but price-gouges are happening for the really new stuff, so this will probably be a build that takes a long time to complete. Ok, new build, probably means new case I guess, since I wasn't super happy with the current case, and then it dawned on me...

Isn't a standard ATX board 8" x 12" ? Hmmmm 12" < 13". What if I could build a computer _inside a kallax compartment_???

### Proof of Concept

I didn't want to quite rush in until I got a good sense of whether this idea was actually possible, so it was time to do some 3D mockups to get a visual/spatial sense of all the components. I used my favorite tool, SketchUp. I'm not yet good at 3D modeling/designing, so I searched on the 3D warehouse for some example motherboards, and searched for a video card and a PSU, and tried piecing some things together in a 13" cube.

### Parts/Cost List

Most of the parts were in USD; some I bought in CAD so I did a rough conversion based on the exchange rate at the time of this post, which was $1.25 CAD : $1 USD. I didn't include tax/shipping/import fees, but I will note that due to the fact I live in Canada, that ended up being a large percentage of the overall cost, at roughly $250 CAD.
