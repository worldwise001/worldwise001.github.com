### me

I am currently a software engineer in privacy engineering (previously mobile security, security infrastructure). I used to do privacy research as a graduate student at University of Waterloo, and organize LAN parties as an undergraduate at SIUC.

I like weird experiments and tinkering with strange systems. I also like knitting, cooking and painting. I sometimes [play (video) games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/worldwise001), and less frequently [stream my gameplay](https://www.twitch.tv/worldwise001).

I have [two cats](https://www.instagram.com/sprinks_n_izzy).

### background and (research) interests

I have a background in software and web development on primarily Linux platforms, generally in systems and infrastructure. I am generally proficient in Java, C, Python, and Rails. I am currently learning Rust and Javascript!

My research focus in a past life has been on privacy problems relating to big data, namely things like: stylometry and profile-linking problems. I am currently interested in data tracing and protection problems; specifically interested in user credential propagation, and scalable access control techniques on a per-field level as opposed to per-table, per-operation, or per-database level. I am also interested in scalable data identification and redaction techniques, which I find akin on the same difficult as spam identification problems.

### contributions
I run a [Tor relay](https://atlas.torproject.org/#details/39F096961ED2576975C866D450373A9913AFDC92). You should too!

My tor relay costs money! If you'd like to donate to my cause, feel free to use one of the links here:

### formal bio
Sarah is an engineer on a privacy engineering team at Square. Her background includes 4+ years of industry experience in security/privacy infrastructure design and engineering, and 4 years of academic privacy research. She has a variety of speaking experience; highlights including organizing and presenting a 300+ person CTF workshop at Grace Hopper, and a series of funny lightning talks on infrastructure security and privacy challenges.

She also has given talks as a hologram, and in general never takes herself seriously.

She can be followed for cats and tech madness on Twitter: @worldwise001.
