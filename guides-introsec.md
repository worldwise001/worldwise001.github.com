I frequently get asked for any resources in security/privacy for newcomers. So I'm going to put my cultivated list here, which may change over time as I see fit.

Security is a pretty vast topic and so the information can be overwhelming. With that said, there are some resources I know of that might be interesting to you.

Disclaimer: some of these may be more opinions than fact, and as with
anything on the internet, you should take things with a grain of salt.
Second disclaimer: you don't actually need to know very much in this
list to ask questions on what we do at Square. Security in Silicon
Valley is done differently from company to company, and the resources
on the internet may not be reflective of that. I'll try my best to
explain what we do and why we do it here, and why wouldn't we do some
other thing like elsewhere does.

Resources:
- Wobsites:

  - Twitter has a lot of security professionals on it
  - I rather like James Mickens' and his humorous takes on the state of
 security, when he writes about it:
    - [This World of Ours](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1401_08-12_mickens.pdf) - article
    - [Not Even Close: The State of Computer Security (with slides)](https://vimeo.com/135347162) - video
    - [Q: Why Do Keynote Speakers Keep Suggesting That Improving Security Is Possible?
 A: Because Keynote Speakers Make Bad Life Decisions and Are Poor Role Models](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity18/presentation/mickens) - video
  - Speaking of USENIX, I really enjoyed Alex Stamos' keynote in 2019:
    - [Tackling the Trust and Safety Crisis](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/stamos)

I probably have other resources available that I'm just not
remembering. I haven't read all of these, and by no means should you
feel obligated to do the same (but you could). It's definitely one of
those topics that will likely lead to going down several deep rabbit
holes to learn about how everything works.
