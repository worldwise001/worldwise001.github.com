### me

I am currently a software engineer in privacy engineering (previously mobile security, security infrastructure). I used to do privacy research as a graduate student at University of Waterloo, and organize LAN parties as an undergraduate at SIUC.

Outside of work I've become more involved with the maker community. I work on hobbyist electronics and 3D printing. Sometimes I will do hobbyist software projects, but that's rare.

I sometimes [play (video) games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/worldwise001), and less frequently [stream my gameplay](https://www.twitch.tv/worldwise001).

I have [two cats](https://www.instagram.com/sprinks_n_izzy).

### work stuff

I have a background in software and web development on primarily Linux platforms, generally in systems and infrastructure. I am generally proficient in Java, C, Python, and Rails. I am currently learning Rust and Javascript!

I wear, or have worn, a number of hats. My title is Software Engineer, but I frequently jump into devops or devsecops or secops problems. Outside of writing software day to day, my responsibilities also include designing software systems, evaluating security systems and processes, mentoring and advising engineers, and interviewing/screening possible candidates. I am fairly flexible on the tech stack, having experience in the following:
- writing/modifying Linux drivers
- writing operating system core software
- writing highly reliable backend services
- machine learning research
- scaling data pipelines
- web/frontend development
- some minor exploits
- administering Linux servers/systems
- administering PKIs

My research focus in a past life has been on privacy problems relating to big data, namely things like: stylometry and profile-linking problems. I am currently interested in data tracing and protection problems; specifically interested in user credential propagation, and scalable access control techniques on a per-field level as opposed to per-table, per-operation, or per-database level. I am also interested in scalable data identification and redaction techniques, which I find akin on the same difficult as spam identification problems.

### contributions
I run a [Tor relay](https://atlas.torproject.org/#details/39F096961ED2576975C866D450373A9913AFDC92). You should too!

My tor relay costs money! If you'd like to donate to my cause, feel free to use one of the links here:
