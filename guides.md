Here are some guides I've written up based on numerous interactions with people asking me about my experiences. Hopefully they are of use to you.

Mandatory disclaimer that these are based on my personal experiences, which may not be the same as yours! So YMMV.

* [Git in 5 seconds](/guides/git/)
* [Baby ML](/guides/baby-ml/)
* [Using your YubiKey to enable secure software development](/guides/yubikey/)

WIP:

* [How to not fail at a PhD](/guides/phd/)
* [So you've graduated. Now what?](/guides/newgrad/)
